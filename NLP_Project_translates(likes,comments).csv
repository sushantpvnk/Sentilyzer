7,1,"The fact that we are having these conversations scares me.
It's very simple, there's men, women and cosplayers.

I am not against people being ""transgender"", but to legally give the thumbs up that they are a gender they are not born as is absurd.."

12,0,"I think I just figured out how I'm going to get on Section 8 and get free rent.

All I have to do is say I'm a woman.... and I have a dependent to take care of.  
Since they can tell me I'm NOT a woman??   I should get the apartment.   
Cause we ALL KNOW they dont give section 8 this to MEN easily!  If at all.

Notice how they cant DEFINE what these people are........ but they have all this help for the people they cant even define.

Its like ""We need equal rights for elephants"".
""Define what an elephant is""
""Ummm ..... an elephant is a large animal"".
""So is a giraffe.  So what makes an elephant an elephant?""
""Well I think we should respect all animals"".
""No you want equal rights for ELEPHANTS.   So tell me what that is so I can give it equal rights"".
"" ...... well.... see.... ""
""Am I an elephant?""
""No.""
""How do you know?""
""You're trying to confuse the topic here. This is about love"".

""NO THIS IS ABOUT EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ELEPHANTS!!!!   DEFINE WHAT ONE IS OR I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO CONSIDER ELEPHANTS RELEVANT CAUSE YOU CANT TELL ME WHAT IT IS I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE EQUAL RIGHTS TO!!! ""

The sad part about this is we HAVE to address this nonsense because if you allow this to fester??   It will grow into something diabolical.
Then well be asking how did it get like this?!    It got like this cause we let them push this on the world unchallenged!!   Now we have a gender civil war going on and people are dying.

THE FACT THAT THEY WONT DEFINE ANYTHING IS WHAT MAKES THIS LOOK LIKE AN AGENDA ......... AND MAKES ME SIDE AGAINST THE VERY PEOPLE THEY ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT!     So well just have to be divided.  Makes no difference to me.  I sleep well anyway."
13,0,"I find this very difficult for people who actually have been born to the ""wrong"" gender and suffer enormously in their lives before entering operations where your gender is changed. I mean, that must be really difficult. (Watch a movie Danish Girl about this topic!) It's a completely different thing than somebody just deciding to ""feel like a woman"" one day. 

I refuse to use terms such as a workperson. I won't go into this madness where you can't use Words such as a boy or a Girl cause someone will get insulted."

55,0,I don't even listen to this insanity life is way too short for nonsense. There's a satanic spirit that has taken hold of the minds of those who are unbelievers and they are too blind to see it.

63,0,"As a small child I wanted to 'BE' a 'tomboy'.  I wanted to do boyish things - climb trees, play with toy trucks and tractors, learn mechanics and carpentry.  (I disliked ""cut-out dolls"" - which were cardboard and you cut their clothes out of the magazine to dress the doll.)  But these desires for 'manly' accomplishments  were programmed out of me. These were NOT considered 'proper' for a girl.  I wanted to study medicine and BE competent ""like a man.""  Instead, I was taught that wasn't ""lady-like"".  So I had to suppress the dreams that I perceived as useful contributions to humanity. Unfortunately, I didn't know what to replace them with and so I made faulty decisions based on these concepts of being ""less than"" and 'needing' a man to survive and thrive.   What a waste of wonderful human potential, a waste of divine dreams."

83,0,"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣SUPER funny. Completely agree with your views on all this ""gender identification'' thing. However, there is one question I would like to ask about this whole gender identification thing. So, gender is basically what genitals you are born with, right? And the sort of people you argued with tonight, are making being gay, lesbian and a pizza (that was such a funny example in my opinion), how are those, genders? I mean, shouldn't that qualify as romantic preferences and not gender identification? And please, to everyone that has read this, please do not take any offence from this please,  I tried to say this in the least rude way I could."

92,1,"Hopefully, Angelica will NEVER give birth!"
93,0,Only people that go through the transformation process should be allowed to identify as whatever they've now become. Period!!
94,0,"People, you are confusing gender with gender identity. You are arguing two separate independent topics. Gender identity isn’t about a penis or a vagina, unless you make it about that. If you asked Piers who he was he’d say he’s a reporter, tv personality, conservative….. the  fact he’s male might not be top of his list. Now imagine he wanted to be a woman. His gender would be closer to the top, like when Bruce Jenner became Kaitlyn Jenner and no longer identified as an Olympian, or male. Identity is fluid like sexuality. Trans people help us define the difference between gender and sexuality. Arguing that someone can’t be the gender they want to be is like arguing you can’t be a superhero. It’s the word “gender” that people are up in arms about. So let’s say there are as many genders as there are people but only two sexes, male and female. So you can ask people what sex they are or you can ask them if they have a penis or a vagina and then ask them if they like their penis or if they’d like to trade it in for a vagina or would they like to have both. Now let’s redefine the word gender to mean, how you feel inside, (like being aware of your feelings). Now think like a 3 year old when the kid pretends to be a cat or a dog. And you ask the kid what they are and they say “I’m a cat!” as if it wasn’t obvious. It’s the same thing. 20-somethings want to be 3 year olds because the world is too stressful. They are children on the inside but adults on the outside which is scary. If humans now live to be 90 and not 70, then we need to push adulthood from 18 to 35. Now you’d think this would make humans extinct due to child bearing years but these kids probably can’t procreate anyway because if they don’t know a penis from a vagina they’re gunna be even more frustrated. If Piers had a teenage child living at home he’d get it. Let’s not butcher or drug our children please but let them play dress up and stay children past 18."

219,0,"I appreciate your feedback on Gadar 2. It seems like you find the film's story promising at the beginning, but express concerns about the shift in tone, especially with Sunny Deol's return. It's interesting that you highlight specific elements like the ""Ud ja kale"" song timing, the handpump scene, and the love story as positive aspects. Constructive feedback can be valuable for filmmakers to understand audience preferences. If there's anything else you'd like to share or discuss, feel free to let me know."

Let's take the example of Uttar Pradesh from 2018; there have been no vacancies in the police, and even if they bring vacancies, there is no age relaxation. After watching videos from Manipur, it's heartbreaking. Still, the Chief Minister is sitting quietly; if it happened with his mother and sister, then he would understand."

Brother, what happened with the help of unarmed Meiteis in the areas of Churachandpur, Moreh, Dolaithabi, Sugnu, Serou, Tangjeng, Napat, as much as the beginning of this story, will kill any animal. In the Indian armed forces, it is necessary for everyone to understand their language. Neither will they understand their language nor my language. They will have to be taught lessons in their own language, but it will not take 2 hours, not half an hour, not even 1 second, to bring them to their knees. But how will all this happen when Assam Rifles is trying to protect the police. The story of this incident will be known only after strict inquiry. Why is he saving, when in front of him he has destroyed the house of Hajjar Meiteiyon, his brothers, sisters and father have been killed in front of him and the one who saved him will start watching the spectacle of being destroyed, it is a matter of pain to bring peace. Major Gauravji, no matter how much you are telling the one sided story of those things, do not forget to realize the ground reality once, do research and you will find some evidence. And the thing is that people are destroying our society by taking such a conscious action with women, because they are giving people the opportunity to take advantage of us, they have burnt everything at home, yet we will never let such people go. The hero has not promised and neither will he. As for the story of Teri Himanta, that is not our CM's shame, this thing is not important, keep your mind open. We never compare ourselves with anyone and we should not do it because we have our own unique charisma. When you talk about humiliating our CM then it becomes necessary to tell this matter. You come and do your research and you will get justice in the story when you know it deeply. Those who do not respect women, their khilaaf has been destroyed and will remain so."

If someone forcibly enters your house, what will you do? If someone claims rights to your land, will you give it? This riot is because of the wrong decision of the High Court, and the High Court, which suggests such things, is more responsible. It's a game of land rights there; the government wants to abolish tribal rights, but the original inhabitants there are tribal. First, send military forces to Bengal; that's where most of the riots happen."

518,0,"India is the brilliant example for the term "" Unity in Diversity"". But where is unity? The single state in India, Manipur is not united, it is divided into two as Meitei and Kuki here the division is not a problem. But the division is due to racism that is the major problem. All the humans are not same they are different they are differentiated based on character, behaviour, responsibilities, their background, etc... But all the humans are struggling for the basic need that is hunger, though they are differentiated they are united as humans. So ""HUMANITY"" is the tool for unity in diversity. An Indian soldier who participated in kargil war has experienced the worst one hour in his life by seeing his wife's worst condition on the brutal hands of the racists. What is the purpose of being a soldier for this bitter and worst India? He lacks his sleep and gets isolated from his family in the motive of protecting all the Indians by sacrificing his life but his family is not protected in his own nation. Rest in peace is a term which is used for the good soul to rest in peace but the Indian soldiers are not in peace on their death. Though they die for the nation they have the pricking thoughts of their family during their last minute of death. Though the soldiers protect our nation the nation is broken into pieces with the name of racism, religion, caste, etc... So that the single state in India, Manipur is not united. So India doesn't deserve the term ""Unity in Diversity"".

541,0,"Manipur current conflict’s root cause can be traced to the government’s strict actions against the drugs mafia operating in the region. Manipur’s geographical location, with a 90% hilly area featuring dense forests and an open border with Myanmar, makes it an ideal location for poppy cultivation and an illegal route for drug and arms trafficking. The crackdown on drug trade by the Biren Singh-led government and the High Court’s judgment to allow Meitei settlement in hilly areas rattled the foreign funded ecosystem and the Kuki drug overlords The strategic location of Manipur, sharing its borders with Myanmar, China, and other parts of India, adds to its geopolitical significance. This also makes it a prime target for external forces seeking to finance regime change operations through illegal activities such as drug and arms trafficking. Blocking the drugs trade acts as a significant obstacle to the financial resources of these external forces.

This conflict was provoked by the drug lords for a selfish purpose. This is a testing period for India. PM Modi knows which international countries funded these drug lords to stir the chaos in Manipur. But it is extremely sad to see the Indian masses blindly believe on what is broadcasted on the media, without knowing the true motive behind this internal conflict.

These drug lords must be gunned down ruthlessly by Indian special forces."

India's population growth rate is 24%
Manipur's hilly region's population growth rate is 102%
NIA clearly said it is because of illegal immigration

During 17 an 18 century
Kooki tribe came from Burma to manipur 
Manipur's king allowed them to live because they were being chased away from Burma 

Methei tribe wanted ST rights
Court agreed to it
They got what they wanted
Why would they start a fight?

Violence was started by kookie tribe 

Half population lives in 10% land ( methei)
Half population lives in 90% hilly land (kokkie and Naga)

Kokkie and nagas (Christian tribes) does opium or poppy cultivation in hilly regions, even after it was not allowed by the government  

Manipur is the native land of methei tribe

Just because one clip went viral does not mean kookies are the victim
What about methei people who were raped or killed

Oh shit! That video didn't go viral so they don't deserve justice ...

But these drug peddlers are being supported by powerful drug mafias operating from Myanmar and China. They are using all means to continue their drug trafficking. Means they have used so far are as follows:
1. Playing tribal card so that all tribals support them.
2. Playing religion card so that all Christians support them.
3. Importing arms and ammunition from others countries and kill Indian citizens

In our history there have always been two tribes which were present since time immorial, Meiteis & Nagas. We are related by common ancestory.
Kukis have always agitated both our communities, when in 1993 Kuki immigrants pushed out a Naga village from the hills, a conflict started between them. The Nagas dominated the conflict and it was foolish if us to save the Kukis from the Nagas.

This is our karma.

660,0,"The narratives is good.. but the sad thing is the meiteei community is attacking and trying to kill the tribals for what the british have done in the past 100/200 years.. so now in 2023 the tribals are suffering for it.. but India Got independence in 1947,, which means if you look at indian independence it cleary shows that the kukizo tribals were never immigrants.. there is no way you call someone an immigrant while they have already lived in the country before its Independence century ago.."

681,0,He always indirectly support BJP government... Like godi media 👎
682,2,When kukis burn down Mahadev mandir assam rifles were standing and watching at kaobru leikha. Assam rifles says kuki are in SoO agreement so they cant do anything. The statue of god the  temple all destroy Assam rifles were there just wstching.
683,0,Come here and see
684,0,Explain with so much detail clearly -  🙏
685,1,"Peace can be brokered in Manipur if certain truths are accepted :-

1. Kukis do not acknowledge that there is a serious drug problem in Manipur and many Kuki militant group leaders are trying hard to give the cause of violence a different angle through propaganda such as 'Saving Christianity', 'Defending the Motherland', 'Kukiland  etc. 

2. Kukis are not thinking long term - Suppose if the Govt turns a blind eye to poppy cultivation, after 10 - 15 years when all forest land is destroyed then what will they do ?

3. Point no. 3. Govt cannot really turn a blind eye to poppy cultivation because all that drug revenue is being used to procure sophisticated weapons from China like Ak-47 and Ak-56 and also import insurgents from an unstable country of Myanmar. Since Kukis tribes live in Myanmar too, it has been a challenge to track down illegals who are also burning down Manipur.

4. Point no. 4 - To paint and depict this strife as a strife between two religions, '300 churches being burnt down' argument was extensively used by Kuki people and media too - both national and international. Upon closer investigation, it was found out that out of the 300 churches, 200 belonged to Kuki Christians and 100 belonged to Meitei Christians. Hence proved that the violence has got nothing to do with religion or even ethnic clashes but it is narco-terrorism.

5. Point no. 5 - 180 innocent people killed, 1000s of innocent people displaced, 50,000 innocent people currently living in various relief camps in Manipur - all these people who have got nothing to do with popppy cultivation or even drugs, people who were satisfied living a simple, peaceful life with whatever little they had - they did not deserve to have their 5000 homes burnt  - All is truly a sign of narco-terrrorism. Whenever Govts and authorities takes action, shake things up, and the narco trade is disturbed, all the weapons procured from drug money are put to use !

6. If one side has purchased three truckloads of sophisticated weapons from China via Myanmar border from drug revenue, the other side would want to have weapons too to protect themselves and their families so they looted police armoury. There is nothing wrong there - Can you expect someone to protect themselves from assault rifles, Ak 47s, Ak-56s and shotguns by using sticks and stones !? Or do you expect the other side to become fatalist, do nothing and simply wait for their and their family murders ??

If Kuki people accept the narco element, peace can be brokered. If they do not want to accept it - sadly, this can stretch on for 1 - 2 years. 

But I have faith in Indian Army and Govt too ! 

Saving Manipur is the responsibility of every Indian citizen. And every Manipuri is our brother and sister. In reality, there are no two sides here ! Just a tragic Indian State which succumbed to narco-violence and instability from a failed State across the border !

We love Kukis and Meiteis equally and Peace will be restored soon !!

Jai Hind ! Jai Bharat !"

701,0,OMG 😱 why can't he just give a direct answer...
702,0,Karan Thapar is the most biased host I have ever seen. He is always seen supporting Kukis. He is not allowing the guest to even put forward his views. Karan is saying home minister has given one sided narrative when he himself is doing the same. What a joke 🤣🤣🤣
703,0,Any government that ignores its people when they are suffering will be eventually punished by the whole. It's a matter if time. Irrespective of party politics India is watching and will decide at voting. No PM has the throne forever and no party is above the law .Eventually change arrives.
704,0,Clearly the BJP government has gone wrong somewhere. Wondering how the leadership sleeps at night when people are waging war. Maybe certain political parties aren't equipped with the right tact to manage certain states. Sad.

722,0,the point is not who started it but that the CM couldn't control the violence- period. it seems like Rajat is talking to either a wall or an imbecile.

731,0,Sir Babloo is the honest man among our Meitei brothers
732,0,"Lying from the beginning, kuki-zo never attact first, meitei started burning down the centenary gate, and after that they started burning down our houses. Your claim of Kuki-zo with sophisticated weapons during the rally is deliberately wrong, very wrong. And your claims of Kuki-zo attacking first is also wrong, very untrue. Shame on you mr. Heigrujam. 
No doubt, meitei are talented in lying."
733,0,"Your claim of DGP and other officers are related to indigenous group is also wrong. How about you question yourself about the relationship of your CM,  some MLAs with arambai tenggol, meitei leepun?"

737,0,"100 times Karan Thapar is trying his best to put words in the mouth of his guest by saying don't blame Kuki Chin people but blame the BJP govt and each time he's ignored. Yet the heading of this video makes a complete mockery of what the guest is saying, typical of Commie liars like Thapar. The interview isn't about what Thapars views are, but on what the Meitei spokespersons are. Gutter journalism of the 3rd grade"
738,0,Wow this kind of Leader really exist haha Thank God I'm not born from a Meitei Community
739,0,Karan you failed to ask the independence movement by meitei. They don't want to be part of Indian Union.

743,0,"There is no meitei who is neutral.
It's either they were a hypocrites or a communal violence eloquency experts"
744,0,Karan Haokip is just standing for illegal immigrant kuki. He will never listen the meetei pts and also he knows where the war started first who started the war . Money is powerful he might got huge amount from kukis else why not he would listen the community voice like illegal immigrant kuki voices
745,0,Mr Karan haokip if u want to support only refugees kukis then don't call meetei spoke person. If u r working as sincere journalist then I can call anyone
746,0,Whenever Karan haokip interview is started I always angry why bcoz he is onesided man. I guess Mr Karan haokip is taken some amount from illegal kuki
747,0,"Since he says that Biren does as directed by centre, does it mean that BIREN HAS NO SAY IN THE MATTER, that he is powerless?

And if so, and if he is a DIGNIFIED PERSON THEN HE SHOULD RESIGN AND LET CENTRE HANDLE THE SITUATION. 

If he is upright and dignified then he should assert his views to the centre.  WHY SHOULD HE BE LIKE A PUPPET. A puppet is not a worthy person"
748,0,"This guy is an andhbhakth. 

State government cannot make a one sided decision"
749,0,He goes on and on about the Kukis.
750,0,"The question is not about who started.
The question here is about governance."
751,0,"His whole tiny brain only revolves completely within his community (Meetei community). He should realise that there is a whole bigger world outside their tiny box as a rep of one community (WMC).
Simply pathetic on responding any of those questions asked."
752,0,Answer just started wit lies meiteis lies over Manipur
753,0,"Heigrujam the father of liar. Don't try to divert the truth. It is Meitei people who start the war. Don't talk nonsense heigrujam.

Thank you Karan sir for stand up with the truth."

755,0,The most unbaised journalism..huge respect Karan sir
756,0,Grandpa is cooking when no one is hungry
757,0,"Lies. Only one or two guy come up with sophisticated weapons as the government or state force were involved, helping the meitei. As Kuki common people at rally cannot fight against the state force helping meitei. Good people from kuki know as insurgent group or militant by others lost control.  Thats it. We can explain more. If no one understands"
758,0,Why any metei  peoples are all in short temper during interviews.they cant calm.
759,0,"Wahh Karan wahh, what is your agenda? When Mr. Bablu said HM information was half true, he meant that the migrant wasn't in last two years, it's been last so many decades. You didn't pick up those points. He was also saying that there should be proper policy to handle the refugee issue. Please be fair on your side and don't pour more oil to the fire."
760,0,Who is this guy? What nonsense is he talking? He's lying. I don't believe him
761,0,At imphal is on 4th may at ccpur is on 3rd may tell us who started
762,0,"I came here to listen to this person, I thought he is a prominent member of the meitei community, an intellectual. Turns out he is a joker and unable to think outside the box. Yeah, when you have a leader like him I dont think the meitei would need enemies, their leader is gonna chew them up only.
It was quite entertaining 😂"
763,0,"These hindustanis....
Karan thapar: You call them hindustanis?? 😂😂😂"
764,0,"Karan : tell formula of water
Heigrujam : it starts from 1,2,3.…...A,B,C,.........."
765,0,"Truth is what you only said 😂 thapr ji
This interviewer is having zero original knowledge....and trying to criticize the honest and  genuine informations.
How humble the MEITEIS are. See!! how cool and calm with all those provocation, while the interviewer is easily irritated with every sentence the guest speak.


Proud of MEITEIS"
766,0,WMC leader turned adeaf ear when asking about the stolen ration of Assam Rifles by meira paibi's😂
767,0,"The guest is so true and genuine.
Money can buy people ...but not truth.
Truth always tirumph.
 Hat's off MEITEIS.
 Never tired of fighting against drugs."
768,0,Stupid chairman......
769,0,He keeps interrupting Karan by saying “let me tell you one thing” then he goes on to evade the question or saying  “nothing” at all..
770,0,The 4 meitei churches burning is also afake and fabricated a naga Christian leaders visit ccp lamka n no church is been torch there is avid in which u will see the churches are still standing
771,0,In the present of assam rifles they cannot attack' so they want to be replaced
772,0,"Majority meiteis are educated , good and wise but unfortunately after all the interviews I came to realise they failed to have a wise and selfless leaders. Btw maybe that's because most of the educated and wise meiteis go into the fields of civil services and bureaucrats. This is the result when you have an uneducated and selfish leaders they lead you to 700sqmi like a fish in a pukhri."
773,0,Karan name should be karan haothukip
774,0,Karan will always ask meitei for all things but he doesn't ask any kukis difficult questions what its show he is one sided
775,0,Meitei and their attitude😂😂
776,0,sophisticated weapons come much after the meiteis attacked KukiZo based on fake news that a girl was raped in Lamka. they brainwashed the innocent meiteis community to attack on kukiZo Tribals
777,0,On 3rd day violence started with burning of Anglo Kuki war gate by the majority people. Mad he DGP was kept out of power by chief minister and even he could not protect his own house. Please open ur eyes meitei people n don’t get deceive by lies.
778,0,Mr Thaper can you explain why sophisticated weapons were seen on peace rally on 3rd May
779,0,Meitei does not attack but do worst then a human are capable
780,0,SOo is agreements with India govt. is peace agreement for the Indian military to keep check on them. But the meitei people can’t even understand that simple definition.
781,0,"question - what color is the sun?
this guy - the sun is a star and  the planets are revolving around the sun"
782,0,WMC is not directly blame that meitei churches were all burned down that is another lie. Manipur Christian chairman who belongs to naga visited the churches which are still standing at Churachandpur
783,0,We don’t know how much kuki paid Karan for this argument 😂😂😂😂 everything to cover up lies is money 💰 why selling drugs they’re filthy rich by selling poppy… just know the truth
784,0,Mr karan why r u targetting only biren singh n wht about other ten mla who want separate state? Do interview about them also then. Salaa paid journalise same on you

787,0,Who knowas he might pee his pants.
788,0,Kaino?

790,0,"Q. What is your name?
A. Because....."
791,0,Now ayet time cm also at sports a function
792,0,"It is worth mentioning that conflicts arise due to differences between parties, and favoring one while vilifying others goes against journalism's principles. If they persist, they may not represent credible journalism. Threatening to end the interview is just as unethical as his approach to analyzing the situation. Remember, this is the exact show where Gracy Zou & Wilson Lalam Hangsing used derogatory terms like ""Animal"" and ""Wolves"" to describe the Meiteis, yet Karan, who conducted the interview, handled the situation responsibly without resorting to threatening to end the interview. This is also the same show where the Prime Minister of India walked out during an interview! Ethical standards of journalism are eroding."
793,0,why kuki karan u never asked to removed 10 MLA
794,0,😂
795,0,Many Hindustani in Manipur 😂🤣🤣
796,0,Kuki are illegal immigrants they are. Against NRC and once NRC implement most of them will have go back to Myanmar😂
797,0,Having fun with questions and answers 😂
798,0,"Yaam ekai khare. We are finally getting to see and hear Meitie-centric narratives. Sad to know that even the opinion of WMC chairman is Meitei-centric. We should look forward to peaceful co-existence with inclusivity.
Regarding poppy cultivation, I believe 10X or 100Y, both are equally punishable. Stop blaming based on numbers. 
Let's restore peace..."
799,0,HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH...... Mr President........😂😂
800,236,"IMPORTANT - JUST my questions have some audio feedback issue - rest of the interview has decent audio. 
We did this episode because we could not find ONE SINGLE place where the whole issue had been broken down and explained. 
If you listen - there is a wealth of info about Manipur. 
Thanks again to Tora from Indian Express for doing this!"
801,0,What a boring and shameful intreview!  Propabley you will ask for more interview s  or he will ask for more. But surely more is to come behind the scene.  Shamelessly flirting on social media on a burning national and regional issue !!!
802,0,This happened coz the cm has the mindset of an underground militant leader. Not a humane politician
803,0,"I jump right into your page as soon as I got access to internet,, you must know that kuki militants are still attacking meitei innocent people"
804,0,"Tora Agarwal whatever you are talking is absolutely wrong, why dont you see how meitei people are suffering, you spread one sided news , meitei people they could not do anything. they are  in the middle and attack by the kukis millitants"
805,0,"Violence proves the politicians and administration have failed to keep talking  with the public. Politicians don't see killings, are busy with the arithmetic of votes. Shameful and regret."
806,0,Plz remove Mary's face. She has no role and input in this riot. All she do is spread misleading false information sitting back in Delhi.
807,0,"This Chaos only goes to bjp govt..who always mixed politics and religion in election.. this party already sowed the seed of communalism, religious difference now it  growing in every part of India."
808,0,This is why   we need independent medias
809,0,"Very well presented. 

But I have a suggestion... when presenting such analysis, it would be a good idea to use a map  or Google Earth to lay out the ""foundation"".
I paused the video and fired up maps in terrain mode  on my mobile to get the hang of the whole picture along with the closeness of the Myanmar border. 
Could easily relate to the tribal cross border associations."
810,0,"Lack of development, illegal poppy plantations ,Illegal immigration from Myanmar  these are main problems"
811,0,Manipur becomes next Kashmir
812,0,"Well reported !!!
You presented facts instead of the blame game, fake news and separatist ideas propounded even by senior journalist like KARAN THAPAR which is not acceptable. Government is to take the blame for the violence and i pray for peace to prevail and dialogues happen to work out solutions acceptable to all the communities ASAP."
813,0,"This is ethnic cleansing !! Poppy cultivation was done not only by kuki ,but by Naga also and the drug Lord are Meitei.the  so called reserved/ protected forest survey carried out by self formed govt officials (meiteis)only target kuki areas ..and the church vandalised or demolised are all kuki church + the CM himself always said that all kukis are illegal immigrants .thats not all ,he himself lied about the history of Manipur.....So,its all well planned !! The state govt disnt step in earlier because he is enjoying his plan carried out by Arambai Tengol and Meetei Leepun"
814,0,Aakash Banerjee dhruv rathee are mostly biased ytuber
815,0,"The kuki might be less in number but they have guns, they are funded,  kuki are able to fled to delhi and other places , meetei suffering in the border are not even having access to internet , forget about it they are struggling for basic need"
816,0,"Here I feel to mention how unpersidented inhuman crimes suddenly and unexpectedly started first by the Kuki militants at Churachandpur at about 1145 am on 03 May 2023 and then  other violence spread out and so on.... Kuki militants started suddenly and unexpectedly firing and burning the houses of Meitei communities who are dwelling at Churachandpur, Meiteis started running aimlessly here and there to save self lives. My daughter also was among those Meiteis running aimlessly who is staying near  Churandpur at Kumbi, at that moment I unknowingly just called through my mobile phone to my daughter but she had replied me so panicky by saying that she was on running to save her life and call you back after saying these she had stopped the call. This is the initiation of unpersidented inhuman crime violence."
817,0,"Here in the dialogues do not mention how,  where and what time by the Kuki militants first initially started unpersidented inhuman crimes suddenly and unexpectedly on Meitei communities dwelling at Churachandpur then further violence spread out."
818,0,Ma'am is very knowledgeable.. Thank you for this video ..
819,0,"Just imagine in the year 2023 when the world is so technicalised,in India,the largest democratic country in the world,a very small state Manipur is burning,where women and children had to run for their lives..this is the sole responsibility of the irresponsible government Mr CM N Biren Singh..I don't want that 3rd may night to happen even in my dream..but that night become my history where I had to save myself and my 1 year old baby from the communal meetei miscreants"
820,0,Really appreciate the knowledge and ability of Torah to explain this complexity in a much unbiased manner..
821,0,"The main culprit of the ongoing riots in Manipur is Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei radical groups who looted Police Training Camps, Police Stations of arms and ammunitions in terms of thousands. With sophisticated weapons, they valiantly went on a rampage on all kuki inhibitants areas. Kukis are just self defending with village volunteers without the help of Insurgent groups which is why the death count on kuki is on the higher side. Mind you, CM Biren Singh is the Overall Chief of Arambai Tenggol and hence the radical group was permitted to have access to sophisticated weapons. Once the carnage started, CM Biren as being the mastermind turned a blind eye to the incidents, restricted all Army personnel to stand down such that his purportedly ethnic cleansing plan could be achieved. With such mindset of the meetei, Kukis won’t succumb to the whims and fancies of the Valley meitei anymore. Separation is the only feasible solution now. Kukis will settle only to Seperate Administration."
822,0,"Hats off to you mam for narrating the facts and not exaggerating , your points are not less or more i just love it"

829,0,"Really relatives, families and friends can travel wherever they want .... miss or mem pliz dont show double standard , just in case if many Pakistani Muslims come to india as they have also relatives in india after the partition...will you accept that? For us, we want to protect our unity and integrity.....Manipur is not a safe heaven for refugees , drug smugglers,  and poppy planters....  plus violence was started by kuki communities just in name of peace rally.. it was a preplanned... A SIT will come out the truth ...plus we saved kukis from Nagas in 1990-1991 ... in terms of mercy No  one can compare with meeteis ...and eviction drive wasn't done only in hill areas ... i think large areas in valley also did the same.. in hill areas it was just started.....Note it down ..and pliz dont show ur laughing face ...it's not a joke ...thanks anyway"
830,0,I can share the link here ...how kuki UGs used AK47 and started shooting to the innocent people and started burning down houses... so retaliation started at Imphal around 7-8 PM ..before that kukis burnt down more than 300 meetei houses between 3-6 PM on 3rd May 2023...
831,0,"Very well discussed, but it’s Indias insecurity to keep porous border ! I’m from Malaysia & why the country is peaceful though they have kits & kins in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia etc; THERE EXTREMELY STRONG NON-POROUS BORDER! They can’t just loiter around each others states like the good olden days ( at present insurgencies to coup any Govt is on International level ) supported by Drug Mafias"

833,0,"What is Manipur 
What are the Real issues of Manipur
These Real Issues are not good for the entire Nation

Poppy Plantation
Influx of Illegal  Chin Kuki Immigrants from  Myanmar 
Why are these people against the crackdown on Poppy Plantation 
Why are these people against NRC

Manipur shares an international border with Myanmar
We are aware  about the happenings in Chin Land Myanmar 

Drugs and Influx of Illegal Chin Kuki Immigrants from Myanmar not good for the entire Nation
ST is just a cover up of these Real Issues 

Please highlight the need for abrogation of SoO with Kuki militants 
Why are armed Kuki militants killing innocent people 
Please highlight the need for implementation of NRC in Manipuri 

The Imphal Valley is Home to Different Communities Not Only The Meiteis 

Manipur is a Hill State

If we do what we must do then Peace and Harmony will prevail 
Please 
A clear understanding of the history of Manipur is very much required and its real issues 

Narco Terrorism
Drugs and Arms are closely connected 

Truth will Prevail
Manipur will Prevail 
Long live Manipur 
Long live India 
Satyameva Jayate"
834,0,"Drugs is just an excuse to paint the kukis... The data says otherwise. Latest data caught with drugs Meetei - 300 , tribals - 700(kuki&Naga) and Muslim - 1000 .

844,0,"For your kind information it's fifty/ fifty about the population, secondly 90% of the land are inhabitat by the hilly people,  thirdly it is not the feelings of the hill people but it is the fact, that 70 to 80 % funds are utilised by the valley people, fourthly valley people are under obc, general, and general category how comes they suddenly demand for the ST quota, are all the quotas are meant for the Meiteis or what , shame on you, you should not mention about Naga tribe, the issues are kukis and Meiteis being an Assamese you should know about the current issues, if  the issues are really The Tribal and the Meiteis, then the Meiteis will be completely wiped out from manipur if Nagas are fighting with the Meiteis, bias information,"
845,0,"No measures are taken, only propaganda by the Meiteis, led by cm namai mathu  biren singh, you Assamese are sold out to Bengalis and muslim as you cannot do anything in your own Assam,"
846,0,"The real violence started with government led by manipuri guy namai mathu biren singh annexed the tribal forest, poppy cultivation and chin migrant are just a cover up, as we Nagas knows the truth, why don't you invite Naga speakers and leaders as the will speak the truth about the violence, secondly why don't you ask or question to those student from Arunachal, Meghalaya, Nagaland, etc about the violence as they will tell the truth, Meiteis were angry when peoples March were going on they branded kukis as terrorist as some clipping were distorted when people saw ak 47 were seen,"
847,1,"All the arms and ammunitions from the police armoury were taken out (stolen) by the manipuri Meiteis, why are you not mentioning, if AK 47 were branded why the people from the valley stole the police and and ammunition, how comes the manipuri meitei biren singh asking and begging the Meiteis to return the arms and ammunition to return and why he said no action will be taken if you return the stolen arms, they should be arrested and be taken to tihar jail, as many kukis were killed by manipuris and were raided their village with the help of police, no foreign or outsiders are involved, shame on you, we Nagas knows very well that you will be diverting the issues, by pointing foreign elements like Chinese in any tribal region excluding Assam, tripura, Sikkim, he rest five States where issues will be always Chinese ,"
848,0,"Yes your right, Manipur is a valley,surrounded by hills.A very small partial of land."
849,0,"Unless a case has been filed in high court for reservation,  high court does not give its verdict.   Secondly when there were disturbances why both center and state were sent all these days.  It may be any party, it shows let the voters (indians) go to hell, we the representatives are comfortable.  Border issues centre sleeping and no talks, no solutions but elections, foreign tours. Inaugurations were more important.  WHAT DOES IT SHOW."
850,0,Her’s analysis and explanation is perfect and unbiased ❤️
851,0,Manipur is still burning due to BJP's incompetent
852,0,"Godra kand happened in 2002,when modi was cm of gujarat and gadar movie was released before that in 2001,now he became pm,kerela files and kashmir files released before elections,i think Bollywood has also some connections with rss bjp.divide and rule policy of bjp"
853,0,Church demolition is an incorrect information before the crashes. The MLA was assaulted after the Kuki people started killing meitei civilians at hill areas. You didn't mention the information. Armed forces are more active at valley than the hills because Kukis are having powerful arms which even indian defence forces don't.
854,0,Thank you for giving the usefull knowledge to the people of India.
855,0,"I didn't expect this from you bhakt Banerjee, you should have find more people to know the ground reality....but thanks for taking up this issue .I only had access to internet today only"

857,1,"I am from Manipur and the things that is happening here reminds me of The film"" kashmir file"" where terrorist kill unarmed civilians and the govt. Did nothing to help them... The same case has been happening here where the kuki terrorist (most of them from Myanmar) kill unarmed civilians of meitei.. Please don't trust everything  they say on social media.. They have been acting like they are the  victim.. The  reality is they are killing unarmed civilians and burning their house"
858,0,"Plz tell us what these militants on on Soo have done to the civilian. 
Why dont you say anything when these militants have fired their automatic rilfes on civilians 
Don’t be biased plz 🙏🙏🙏"
859,0,You are right that there was no violence for the last few years but after Mathis govt came into power they have worked to destroy the kukkis even if they have bjp supported. This is a cheat and deceit
860,0,Eradication of one Religious people by another religious group

864,0,Still Manipur Issue Is No Solve Yet Daily Firing And Burning Of House Continues
865,0,"Even from the beginning it's completely and utterly without thorough study, the clash is between meitei civilians in the foothills and myanamarese kuki militants supported by Chinese to destabilize the Northeast. ""Kuki""  doesn't include all tribals. There are nagas, kabuis and 30 other tribes living peacefully with the meiteis in the valley."
866,0,"The violence was started to create an image of enimity between Meitei and Kuki, hence the need for segregation and separate administration. A greed of a few to get more access to more central funding and grants resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Meitei doesn't stand to gain anything from it besides notoriety(mostly from false propaganda), lost of lives and property. Kukis has their long time demand and they intend to get it through bloodshed."
867,1,Meetie n Kukis Nage we have no rivalries..may be some dissatisfaction but nothing else . All the violence is not responsible by my Kuki bros nor my Meeteis bros .but bet aware...kuki bros those whome u think is ur friends are not what u think ...let's live in peace as always ..
868,1,My wife is a Christian n m a Hindu we face no problem...then why this
869,0,Well informative interview. The violence is happened from both side and we should not support it. But blaming each community is just stupid thing and never ending story.
870,0,"I understand your concerns about the situation. The issue of narco-terrorism and illegal drug trafficking is a serious concern, and it is important that steps are taken to address this problem.

In addition, the issue of illegal immigration and naturalization of immigrants is also a concern that needs to be addressed. It is important to ensure that the proper measures are in place to prevent illegal immigration, and that those who are already naturalized are following the laws of the country.

Regarding the armed terrorists with sophisticated weapons, it is important for the appropriate authorities to investigate and take action against those responsible for these acts of violence. This is both a matter of national security and a responsibility to protect the innocent civilians who are affected by such violence.

It is a complex issue that requires cooperation and efforts from various government agencies, as well as the cooperation of the local community. I hope that steps will be taken to address these issues and promote peace and security in the affected areas."
871,0,"the myanmar military coup card is not that a humungous issues as played out by the meiteis, of course there were refugees sheltering but it was only in 100s and not even in 1000s as the Manipur Govt was unwelcoming. And the world acknowledges the Myanmar military coup, the refugees were legally a guest and foreigners, a well established govt like Manipur govt (who has a good ties with the Modi govt) need not feel insecure to the point of violence and could have handled that situation wisely. These are just political cards played out by the Biren Govt to execute his plan of wiping out the KUKis in Manipur."
872,0,If BJP led Union govt is not able to restore peace and bring law & order in a small state like Manipur. This shows the incapability of Union Govt…..Its better that PM Modi step down from his post.
873,0,Basically it's state government plus the state sponsored radicals versus the Kuki communities. Remember what happen in Germany during the times of Hitler

879,0,A journalist from Manipur  would  have known better .. I’m assuming 🥸.
880,0,"Lets all not forget manipur  has a porous  border and  immigrants  from across myanmar come to settle in manipur.. Satellite images shows so many kuki villages cropping up in a very short time .. The common innocent kuki friends may not even know this..educated elite are part of this. How can they allow people from across the border to come into manipur and become scheduled tribes by defaut. The original ctizens are getting deprived of resources because of this.. M not saying all kukis are immigrants.. But this is a cause for concern.. And the demand for a seperate kukiland was fored long ago.. May 3rd was the trigger.. The mainland indians should take it as a threat to national security if they are concerned about the north east.. Coz its not only about manipur.. Its about the other north east states too.. We may become extinct in the next few decades if seperate asministration is given.. If NRC is not given, atleast we can start a SRC or state registry of citizens to protect the indigineous  people... ."

889,0,get that cm out of there
890,0,this woman is playing safe and probably biased. maybe she herself is meitei.
891,0,"Mizoram feels like a mini north india. I think the bjp government is experimenting there first before implementing nrc,etc. In the whole of india."
892,0,"While this is a level-headed dialogue, there are several points that need to be taken into account not simply as umbrella events of Northeast but specifically of Manipur as a Sixth Schedule tribal area and repercussions of such constituonal statutes. Perhaps involving  community members and academic experts on discussions over this issue of land rights in plains tribal areas and hill tribal areas will make the discussion more relevant rather than a compilation of facts based on secondary sources. Wishing the best and praying for peace."

In this both the communities are responsible.  They will have to work together to find a solution for this.  It will not end with violence.  Rather this will spoil the future of thousands of innocent people.."
934,0,"""When an individual or a group raises their concerns openly, it becomes a matter that affects the entire community. It's puzzling to see that other nations are not engaging in this issue, especially when their own government has failed their citizens significantly. India has projected itself as a nation that exhibits bullying, intimidation, and disregard for women's rights, which is difficult to comprehend, considering it is often referred to as a country that is respected and likened to a mother. The incidents of rape and molestation within the country reflect poorly on its culture. It is disheartening to witness a situation where some men resort to mistreating women to prove their masculinity."" Rebecca Chandran - Melbourne Australia"
935,0,"In fact, only such women should be elected as Rajya Sabha MPs and Lok Sabha MPs who can put other issues facing women on the table of the Parliament. If there is humanity in any party, their respect should be restored and the criminals should be given harsher punishment than hanging."

First, teach your people about law and a strict system, whether the wrongdoer belongs to any religion, they should fear that the country's law is very strict, and if they commit a crime, they will face severe consequences. Then see how people reform, whether it's India, Pakistan, or any other country. Those who play politics in the name of religion should be given a clear message to shut up; we will not allow anyone who engages in religious politics to get our vote. Believe me, on that day, many crimes will come to an end."

Now ask your self just by fulfilling 10000 yrs karma 10000 yrs meditation and 10000 yrs gyan do you deserve to Be One with the Creator consciousness.
If such is the thinking of Man then this is Ahunkara (arrogance and pride - a mortal sin ) 

This is wht the Serpent (Kundalini) said to Eve (womankind) and  Adam (mankind) You can be God.........
YOU CAN'T 
If divinity can be acquired by the 3 yogic paths then such divinity is pathetic.
A man can become god then god is pathetic. 

Creator of all Creation Our Father ( 'I am that I am) is HOLY and beyond perception of Man. 
Humankind had Holy(sinless) bodies and soul before the fall from Eden.
To Gain something you have to sacrifice something of equal value. 

To regain Holiness you have to sacrifice Holiness. And only YHWH is Holy so YHWH became flesh and blood (Son of Man) He served the least and vulnerable of people and was sacrificed on the CROSS.
Through that sacrifice of Body and Blood  mankind can gain Holiness and be Unity with their Creator forever. 

Such is the Unconditional Love of Our Father Creator.
Salvation is not attained by deeds by The  GRACE OF THE GOD OF ALL CREATION."

You can just hear it in the way he uses his words. At the end of the day, anyone is free to choose their religion. Nobody is forcing any religion down someone's throat in this day and age, if they want to convert to any religion– Hinduism, the Abrahamic religions– they are free to do so. It's their free will. Promote your religion, it's okay. You're free to do so, but force it upon people. And don't promote your ""hot take"" and get people to think like you. This video essay/news report is tinged with bias. As someone who has taken it upon his shoulder to ""report"" on certain socio-political things, with a large audience, it is your responsibility to be unbiased and truth-ful, objective, and secular and diplomatic.

We are not the ones who started with this demand for separate administration, you forcefully removed us from your Manipur after you targeted not only innocent civilians but also Government servants and elected Ministers from our community.

1192,0,"Kukis are indians

They are not immigrants"
1193,0,"Violence, as we hear in Manipur, can not be accepted against any female folks & children. Degeneration of a society starts when it doesn't treat its women and children in the best way their means permit. The fear of the law has to be instilled in all. But that does not take away the (Christian) KUKI community's responsibility, who started this awful cycle of racial rioting/arson against their neighbours in society on the back of a mere High Court order.
A similar thing happened in Gujarat. It's easy for some communities to become victims of the cycle of violence people of their own start off. In Godhara, a train full of karsavaks was burned, and did those Muslims in Godhara ever get condemned by the rest of the Muslims in Gujarat for destroying the lives of all Muslims and society in Gujarat by unleashing the cycle of violence. 
In a population of 1.4 billion, the responsibility of the Media is higher to fix responsibility at the societal and administration levels correctly. 
Western media houses are concerned only because one party and Kukis, in this case, is Christian. Is not this blatant and open religious colonialism. Do they think Western societies serve Indian Christians more/better than the government/democracy of India?
Have any media (Indian or Western) called a spade a spade in terms of those who start such a cycle of riots and arson? 
Unless those who start riots and arson, in this case, Kukis, against their neighbours for decades are not named and shamed, how will other societies be warned from starting similar riots? 
How many such cycles of riots can the Democratic administration control/crush without killing innocents on either side who are driven by the after-effects of the first riot/arson?"
1194,0,It was not a peacefull rally. Some kukis people with weapons was to be seen. After ther rally they started burning down houses of meiteis . I think This was the mean reason meitei people got angry.
1195,1,"IMF-CIA is behind all the chaos around the world because Thailand India has disobeyed US, is with Russia, can investigate history, can investigate secretly it is very bad (Indians know the truth Must be that USA + CIA is behind the scenes)"

1199,0,"It is religious persecution. Encouraged by Modi and the BJP, encouraging religious persecution for a Hindu only country goal. Reminds me of Hitler's and communism's goals and methods.   Christians in India and persecuted Christians around the world, we stand with you! God be with us all."

Known drug connections/involvement in:

Tamu (Myanmar)-Moreh (Manipur)-Imphal (Manipur)

Mandalay (Myanmar)-Tiddin-Singhet (Myanmar)-Churachandpur (Manipur)-Imphal (Manipur)

Mandalay (Manipur)-Tiddin-Singhet (Myanmar)-Champai (Mizoram)-Aizawal (Mizoram)-Imphal (Manipur)"
1490,0,"MANIPUR SITUATION IN SHORT - More than 100 days passed. Still firing. No effective measure to contain the violence. Death 182+,missing 17+,person with bullet injury 200+,displaced people 70,000+, people on relief camp 50,000+, houses burnt 40,000+. 

Root cause - 1. Narco Terrorism and 2. Illegal immigrants. Helped by leaders with vested interest.  Worst part - kuki militants use Snipers, drones, land mines, vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) etc. Sophisticated weapons coming from Myanmar to attack meiteis at foothills area, that even Indian army don't use.

Started from kuki dominated area Churchandpur on 27 April destroyed New Gym Centre to be anaugurated by CM. 28 April, all CCTV of entire town demolished to falsify evidence. On 3rd May,2023 - 12+ churchandpur localities of meitei,  some of Moreh and kangpikpi  meitei were completely wiped out(ethnic cleansing). Many meitei woman were raped in Churchandpur on 3rd May.

Land reforms act 1960. Exclusion of hilly(tribal) status of meitei in 1949 when Manipur merged with Indian union, because of that  meitei can not buy land in hilly areas and also in valley that is once owned by tribal. Meetei population 52% live in only 7% land including all other communities. Finally, meitei's would probably become kasmere pandit.

Kuki militants are very powerful now with drug money and church support internationally. It's a national security threat. Mizoram in support. They get help from Myanmar, Bangladesh cos of ethnic relationships. They want a kuki land taking a part of India, Bangladesh, Myanmar. It's a clash between - ""Indigenous and non-Indigenous"". Meitei's have 2000+ year old Indigenous culture and civilization whereas Kuki's don't.

No one talks of burning many 200 years old Meitei Temples(Mandirs). 4 churches are burnt by kuki only. 250 + Churches burnt were of meitei's only, that nobody mentioned. Many Meitei pastor houses were burnt in Churchandpur.

Not allowed to visit meitei sacred places Koubru,Thangjing,Marjing etc.(holy place of meitei's) in last couple of years. Meiteis are the only ethnic group who still worship umanglai(jungle) as Lai Haraoba. Then, how can meiteis not related to hills?

Where is ""Linthoingambi""(a 17 year old meitei girl from Tera, missing)? Can anyone answer? A meitei grandmother Sorokhaibam Ibetombi(80) was ""BURNT ALIVE"" in Serou, that nobody talks about. This the obviously, the worst violence that the nation has ever faced. Everyone should look at both sides and the details.

Couple of facts - 1. Who carries gun AK47 on peace rally ?
2. At 2.15pm imp office building burnt on 3rd May in ccpur.
3. By 3.43pm houses at boljang and torbung started burning. Hearing the news, meteis reacted by late evening after 9pm and 4May.

5 questions 
1. Why did kuki militants forced civilians to buy guns for every household in kuki dominated areas, the last 1 to 2 years?
2. Why was the CCTV cameras vandalized on 28th April, 2023 for entire Churchandpur town, before big event 3 rd May, 2023?
3. Why maximum Kuki's were on leave starting last week of April 2023 working in the valley?
4. If kuki want separate administration, why not approach the right authority through legal procedure instead of violence(burning houses & ethnic cleansing of meiteis)?
5. Why they use Zomi Revolutionary Army flag in last rally, are they still Indian?

I am sure, everyone is sensible enough to understand the facts, if it was a well planned or not. ""Facts never lie"". 3rd May was just an excuse.

Central government hasn't done any effective measure yet  to contain the violence. Letting people to kill each other. People of Manipur are dying in extremely worst situation. Let's not be one sided. Get facts of both sides. Let there be justice and punish culprits of both sides.

Solution - 1. Revoke SOO 2. Pass NRC 3. Build strong border 4. Restore Meitei Tribal status to equalize land issue 5. Improve VDF to protect foothill villages.
