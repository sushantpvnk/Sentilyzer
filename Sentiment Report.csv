2023-11-21,Merijn Hugens,"The Israeli Ministry of Intelligence is recommending the forcible and permanent transfer of the Gaza Strip’s 2.2 million Palestinian residents to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, according to an official document revealed in full. The transfer plan is divided into several stages:

In the first stage, action must be taken so that the population of Gaza “evacuates south,” while the air strikes focus on the northern Gaza Strip.
In the second stage, a ground incursion into Gaza will begin, leading to the occupation of the entire Strip from north to south, and the “cleansing of the underground bunkers of Hamas fighters.”
Concurrently with the re-occupation of Gaza, Palestinian civilians will be moved into Egyptian territory, and not be allowed to return. “It is important to leave the travel routes to the south open to enable the evacuation of the civilian population toward Rafah,” the document states.",0,Positive,0.296

2023-11-21,Merijn Hugens,"Israel has built all the facilities underneath al-Shifa, Israel expanded the hospital complex, and in the 1980s, gave it a major overhaul, with Israeli architects. Along with the medical facilities, the project reportedly saw the construction of “a secure underground operating room and tunnel network” underneath the Hospital’s Building Number 2 in 1983, with a large “underground concrete floor” constructed underneath the facility during the same period. Other reports indicated that the hardened underground facilities were used to house the hospital’s laundry and “various administrative” offices.

2023-11-21,Merijn Hugens,"""Operation Al-Aqsa Storm"" was a false flag operation, who really believes that the Mossad knew nothing about it? They are probably the best intelligence agency on this planet and have a vast network of recruited informants inside Gaza who would report on any training or movements. The Egyptian government warned Israel ten days before the attack for ""a terrible operation"", Netanyahu must have had foreknowledge of the October 7th attack. How come border crossings were wide open? Israel has an extensive electronic and physical wall backed by soldiers and weaponry, that completely surrounded Gaza on the landward side, so effective that it was claimed that not even a mouse could get in. The Mediterranean side of Gaza was also tightly controlled by the Israeli Navy and boats, so Gaza was under 24/7 complete surveillance and control at all times. 80% of the IDF forces that were supposed to be at the border of Gaza, were stationed on the West Bank in the days before the Hamas attack, supposedly for ""security concerns"". Even MSM is reporting that it is forbidden for IDf-soldiers to speak the complete truth. ""Operation Al-Aqsa Storm"" has resulted in the deaths of 1,400 Israelis and to date around 10,000 Palestinians. In my opinion ""Operation Al-Aqsa Storm"" was a carefully formulated Israeli plan to wage an all out war against the Palestinian people to wipe Gaza off the map. Forced migration of 2.2 million Palestinian residents to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula for the construction of the Ben Gurion Canal & to confiscate Palestine’s maritime natural gas reserves.

The evidence presented in the 86-page “Complaint” is clear and may be overwhelming.
The first claim that the U.S. has failed its duty under law to prevent the genocide of Gazans is obvious. The second claim that Biden, Blinken and Austin bear responsibility for the genocide – whether the crime is of aiding and abetting, or of complicity in genocide, or of inciting, or of conspiring to commit genocide by supporting a clearly expressed intention of genocide may be obvious to common sense, but vulnerable to disagreement when legal terms of international law need clarification under U.S. domestic law.",0,Negative,-0.5927

Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict was supported by 74% of the people surveyed, compared to 66% overall who approve of the president. 43% said Biden’s approach to the crisis made them more positive towards him.

Almost six in ten said they trusted Biden to tackle anti-Semitism in the US, a problem that more than 90% of respondents found concerning. Younger poll respondents were also worried about other forms of bigotry, such as racism and Islamophobia.

An overwhelming 91% said a person can be critical of the Israeli government but remain “pro-Israel”. A smaller majority of 76% expressed that view in relation to Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza.

The Israel Defense Forces besieged the Palestinian enclave in retaliation for a Hamas cross-border incursion last month, in which over 1,200 Israelis people were killed. Critics say Israel’s retaliatory military action has disproportionately killed Palestinian civilians. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 11,000, according to local authorities.

US Democratic voters are increasingly drawn to the Palestinian cause, according to a Quinnipiac University poll published on Thursday. The share of respondents more sympathetic to Israel than to Palestine dropped from 61% to 54% between mid-October and mid-November.

Woe to the Cherethites, inhabitants of the seashore, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, for the word of the LORD is against you, for I will destroy you and leave you without an inhabitant.

The seashore will be a meadow, with shepherd's huts and sheepfolds there.""

All these disasters are happening to fulfill the Prophecy of wrath that does not follow GOD's Word.

We humans can 'never' oppose or criticize GOD's will, but we can avoid GOD's Fierce Wrath and save our souls.

We must believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the only begotten Son of GOD, who paid for the sins of the world and us humans through the cross, and follow His will!

The only way to avoid the Fierce Wrath of GOD and to not stand in Judgment is to Believe and keep the Words of the LORD JESUS CHRIST.

Psalm 2:7,12.
I proclaim the commandment of the LORD. The LORD said to me, “You are my son; today I have begotten you.”

Kiss his Son, lest he be angry with you, and you perish from your way; for his wrath is kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in the LORD.""

And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”*
Gospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 25 to 28.

Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16 to 18.

In response the IDF took the lives of over 10,000 innocent Palestinian civilians, mostly being children and counting.
In this day and age with all the resources at the IDFs disposal and all the advancement in technology, surely there was no better approach then to bombard Refugee Camps and Hospitals.
Such a hypocritical thing to say that Hamas has been lying, when there is an abundance of videos online exposing the lies of the IDF under the direction of the Israeli Government Officials.
I could even go as far as to speculate that October 7th could very well have been done in cooperation with the IDF and under the direction of the Israeli Government Officials, just as how people speculated with what happened with 9/11.
There's hard-proof evidence that has been released recently that Egypt tipped off Israel about the October 7th plans from Hamas prior to the attack and yet no action was taken by the IDF.
Just speculation on my part, but was the IDF even alerted by this tip from Egypt or did the Israeli Government Officials keep it on the down low?
How fortunate for the Hamas fighters to calmly parachute down into the music festival without any resistance from the IDF on October 7th.
Seems like the Israeli Government Officials wanted any excuse to commit ethnic cleansing, since they couldn't find one, they planned and staged one them-selves.

2023-11-19,YSBS1,【谬论五】：阿拉伯国的领土大部分是丘陵和贫瘠地区。犹太国则不然，大部分位处沿海地带，土地肥沃。【张平批驳】：读至此，聪明的读者自己大概就能批驳这条谎言了。犹太国绝大部分土地是内盖夫荒原，既不在海边，也跟肥沃扯不上边。犹太国土地最肥沃的部分在加利利东部的耶斯列山谷和胡拉沼泽地。这两块地方在阿拉伯人手中的时候，都是沼泽绝地，蚊虫成群，疟疾肆虐。是犹太人重金将这些土地买下，披荆斩棘地用现代技术将其改造成了良田。沿海平原虽然也有一些农田，但主要是拥有特拉维夫和海法两座现代城市。这两座城市都是犹太人建立的，其中的阿拉伯人口主要是依附于犹太经济的移民人口。这些土地，就算分给阿拉伯人，阿拉伯人好意思拿吗？反观阿拉伯人拿到的土地，北方加利利西部沿海地段北连有中东瑞士之称的黎巴嫩，苍松翠柏，绿草相映，水源丰富，是本地区最好的土地之一。南部沿海的加沙地带，拥有极其适合耕作的农业用地。中部丘陵地带拥有当地稀缺的地下水资源，虽然谈不上肥沃，但绝对是适合人类居住的地区，比内盖夫荒原不知好到哪里去。东边的约旦河谷更是肥沃的农耕区。这样的条件还宣称贫瘠，难道真的只有天堂才适合他们住？【谬论六】：以色列复国是因为欧洲反犹主义，应该在欧洲复国而不是在巴勒斯坦地区。【张平批驳】：民族自决权包括一个民族认定和选择自己所拥有的土地的权利！当然这种权利的实行需要获得国际社会的公认。因此，犹太民族和世界任何民族一样，有权利选择自己的家园。在国际社会承认之后，犹太人对自己的土地所拥有的权利和任何一个民族与自己土地的关系一样，都是神圣不可侵犯的。在这一点上，如果一定要纠缠历史旧账的话，阿拉伯人更没权利“说三道四”，如果不是他们当年入侵占领了犹太人的故土，如果不是他们在三十年代阻挠犹太人的回归，犹太人也不至于流离失所到那个程度，甚至面临大屠杀也无处可去。 【谬论七】：以色列占用了巴勒斯坦人的土地建国。【张平批驳】：这说法只有一个问题：巴勒斯坦人凭什么说这些土地是他们的？决定一块土地的归属，大概可以有这样一些形式：历史权利，现实存在，国际条约，战争结果。巴勒斯坦人在历史上从未建立过自己的政权，对这块土地从未拥有任何历史权利；私人土地所有权模糊不清，现实存在同样是一笔糊涂账。1947年的联大分治决议实际上是巴勒斯坦人历史上第一次合法拿到自己的土地，但又联合阿拉伯各国发动灭绝以色列的战争，结果把分来的土地也丢了一大半，停火时绿线给了犹太人80%的土地，阿拉伯人只留下20%，跟当年皮尔委员会的方案正好翻了一个个儿。需要说明的是：巴勒斯坦人联合各国发动侵以战争，表明他们不承认这个国际条约所给予他们的土地，而选择用战争的方式来解决问题，因此土地的划分就由战争的结局来决定了。阿拉伯人不能自以为强大就诉诸武力，打了败仗又去引用联合国的决议，即使他们依仗人多势众把持了联合国，也不可能这样把天下好事都占全了！所以国际社会对以巴领土问题的解决是以绿线为基础，而不是以47年分治决议为基础。失败的侵略者通常丧失土地，这是国际惯例，两次世界大战中的战败国都是如此。天底下大概只有我们中国人讲究以德报怨，是个例外。犹太人在这块土地上三次建立有效政权，拥有无可置疑的历史权利，而且主流犹太传统从未放弃过这种权利。近代犹太复国主义通过合法手段，增强了犹太民族在这块土地上的现实存在。47年犹太国接受联大分治决议，并明确表示愿意与阿拉伯国和平共处。48年犹太国打赢了反侵略战争，合法拓展了自己的疆土并得到国际承认。今天，以色列国愿意让巴勒斯坦人在绿线之外的土地上建国，并撤出自己的军队，只要这个国家不威胁以色列的安全。因此，无论从哪个角度说，绿线之内以色列的每一寸土地都是应得的，绿线之外的土地以色列随时可以交还（定居点其实是说撤就撤的东西，西奈半岛和加沙地带都是先例），并不是以色列建国的一部分。总之，以色列在土地获取方面并没有超越国际惯例，更不是在巴勒斯坦人的土地上建国的！!!,1,Neutral,0.0
2023-11-19,YSBS1,"巴勒斯坦土地问题的七大谬论【谬论一】：分治前，93%（版本不同，有说95%的，有说绝大多数的）的土地是阿拉伯人的，犹太人只收购了6%多一点的土地。跟这个谬论放在一起的，通常是一张地图，上边把巴勒斯坦整个涂成了绿色，只留下一些白点代表犹太土地。【张平批驳】这个谬论一半是事实，一半是谎言：犹太人那6%多是真的，阿拉伯人那93%则是赤裸裸的谎言！无论是在奥斯曼土耳其时代还是英国托管时期，巴勒斯坦地区的绝大多数土地都是国有（公有或君王所有）的土地，比如占地13，000多平方公里（巴勒斯坦总面积的50%左右）的内盖夫大荒漠，一战前是土耳其苏丹的土地，托管时期是皇家土地，也就是女王陛下的产业，从来也不是私人土地（谁会傻到去购买没用的荒漠的地步）。阿拉伯人想说这土地那时候是他们的，也没查查自己的血是不是蓝的。那么阿拉伯人究竟在巴勒斯坦占有多少土地呢？任何一个负责任的学者都会告诉你：没人知道！犹太拥有的土地情况，都是在土耳其和英国的土地管理部门登记了的，虽然只有6%，但每一笔都白纸黑字，清清楚楚。阿拉伯人则无论自称有多少土地，都很少能拿出相关文件来证明。如果真按登记过的土地所有权来计算，阿拉伯人的土地占有率即使能超过6%，恐怕也多不出多少（土耳其人隐瞒了相当一部分土地登记资料，因此无法完全确认）。【谬论二】：巴勒斯坦人以法拉赫方式拥有巴勒斯坦的土地。【张平批驳】因为拿不出土地所有权的证明，阿拉伯学者及其追随者们便发明了一个所谓的法拉赫所有权，宣称巴勒斯坦人是以这种方式拥有土地的。所谓的法拉赫土地所有权，是指一种阿拉伯人传统上的按村庄分配土地使用权的方式，也就是每个村庄每年给各户分派土地耕种，得到土地的家庭只能使用，并不拥有，下一年则重新分派。这本来是一种土地使用方式，并不涉及所有权问题（严肃的有关伊斯兰土地所有制度的文献里通常不会把法拉赫当作一种土地所有形式，谈论这种土地所有形式的论文和书籍通常都是涉及以巴之争的），因此在法拉赫系统中，搞不清土地的所有人是谁，搞不清土地的方位和大小，搞不清土地的交易情况。任何财产登记制度都不可能登记这种土地，所以无论是奥斯曼帝国还是英国托管当局，都不承认这是一种土地所有权，以色列国自然而然也不承认。退一万步说，即使我们承认这种土地所有权，阿拉伯人的土地也多不到哪儿去。按照英国当局在20年代和30年代的两次统计，巴勒斯坦地区的可耕作土地大约是33%左右。42年国联做过一个评估，认为聚居地区阿拉伯人的土地拥有率大约在68%左右。按这个估算，阿拉伯人拥有土地的数量应该是33%乘0.68，也就是23%左右。就算我们再送给巴勒斯坦人10%（考虑到城镇里的巴勒斯坦人），也就是30%左右，换句话说，即使把口说无凭的土地都算上，离阿拉伯人自称的93%也还差着十万八千里。 【谬论三】：巴勒斯坦地区的阿拉伯人有120多万，占总人口的2/3强。但分治决议中的阿拉伯国的领土只占巴勒斯坦总面积的43％。犹太人虽仅有60万，不到总人口的1/3，然而其领土却占巴勒斯坦总面积的57％。所以分治决议不合理。【张平批驳】巴勒斯坦分治，本来是两个民族国家的建立，跟人口多少没有任何关系！就好像继承遗产，讲的是名分，跟各家人口多少不相干。退一万步说，就算你可以把人口和土地联系起来，这个谬论依然是个谎言，因为它隐瞒了土地质量问题！犹太人拿到了57%不假，但50%是上文所说的内盖夫大荒漠，除个别绿洲外，绝大多数是不适合人类居住的地区，在40年代末尤其如此。即使是在现代以色列，在发明了先进的滴灌技术开发了世界领先的荒漠农业之后，内盖夫地区的绝大多数土地仍然是荒无人烟的。换句话说，犹太人分到的土地里，只有7%是适合居住的，加上荒原里的个别绿洲，总可居住面积不会超过10%。而阿拉伯人拿到的43%的土地，除死海边上少量地块外，全部是可居住土地（详见下文）。巴勒斯坦土地分配不是一个新话题，早在1936年，英国的皮尔委员会就提出过一个分治方案，那次是把包括内盖夫在内的80%左右的土地分给阿拉伯人，犹太人获得北部约20%的土地。阿拉伯人对此断然拒绝。47年的分配，犹太人拿到了阿拉伯人不想要的内盖夫，土地面积远远低于阿拉伯人当初得到的80%，阿拉伯人仍然是不愿意。实际上从这两次划分，我们可以看出划分者的一个基本原则：拿到好土地的一方少拿点儿，拿到坏土地的一方多拿点儿。无论谁来评判，都不能说这不是一个公平的原则。因此阿拉伯人抱怨土地划分不公，只是一个借口，根本上是想在巴勒斯坦地区搞种族清洗，无论怎样划分都不会满意的。【谬论四】：阿拉伯国的领土支离破碎，互不相连。【张平批驳】：一块土地被分成了六块，每方各拿三块，自然都是互不相连的。阿拉伯的国土互不相连，犹太人的国土又何尝是相连的？在这样明显的问题上都说一半藏一半，难道想欺天下人都是弱智不成？.,.,.,",2,Neutral,0.0
